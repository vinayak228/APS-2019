Different approaches to deal with array query problem.

1) Look up table : Works with the mechanism of processing the array into a key-Value pair and keeping a track of the minimum value present                    in the array.Because of this mechanism the time complexity to create the look up table is O(n^2) but once this is done 
                    the querying time is a constant i.e O(1).
                    
2) Square root decomposition method: The array is compressed into a size of root-N if the size of the array is N. The elements of the                         decomposed are sum of the respective ranged sub-array.This method is efficient in sub-array sum problems.The time                         complexity of decomposed array is O(root-n).

3)Segment tree: The array is split into two equal parts in such a way that it follows a strict binary tree. The root node represents the 
                     entire array where as the leaf nodes represent each indiviual element of the array. This method is best suited for 
                     range query problems and sub_array sum problems such as finding the min-max elements in a given range. It follows a 
                     complexity of O(log n) in querying the elements.
